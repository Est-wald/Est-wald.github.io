  ......<br>
  I offer you that kernel of myself that I have saved,<br>
  somehow --the central heart that deals not in words, traffics not with dreams, and is untouched by time, by joy, by adversities.<br>
  I offer you the memory of a yellow rose seen at sunset, years before you were born.<br>
  I offer you explanations of yourself, theories about yourself, authentic and surprising news of yourself.<br>
  I can give you my loneliness, my darkness, the hunger of my heart;<br>
  I am trying to bribe you with uncertainty, with danger, with defeat.
