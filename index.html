<p>Interest: Roughly speaking, my interest lies between representation theory and algebraic geometry.
  In particular, I am interested in the geometric Langlands program.

  This is also related to modern physics like quantum field theory and string theory.</p>

    There is a famous book <i>Love and Math</i> by Ed Frenkel. Accordingly, 
  Vanya Karpov once made an assertion: "Some mathematicians work for <i>love</i> while some work for the <i>Langlands program</i>."</small>
