<p>This is Xinyu Li's homepage. My nickname Estwald comes from Isaac Asimov's novel <i>The Gods Themselves</i>.</p>
<p>I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, majoring in mathematics.</p>

<p>Interest: Roughly speaking, my interest lies between representation theory and algebraic geometry.
  In particular, I am interested in the geometric Langlands program. This is also related to modern physics like quantum field theory and string theory.</p>
<p>I orgnized several seminars with friends.</p>
